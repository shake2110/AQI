Air Quality Index Prediction

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques. It is based on the GeeksforGeeks AQI prediction dataset and approach. The model analyzes key features like pollutants and weather parameters to estimate air quality levels.

Features:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights

Machine learning model training and evaluation

AQI prediction based on input values

Tech Stack:

Python

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

This project is a step toward applying ML in environmental monitoring and can be further extended with deep learning or real-time AQI prediction systems.
